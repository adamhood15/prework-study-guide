# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I recently enrolled in a coding bootcamp with Rice University and am starting to learn the basics of web development. During the course I found myself taking lots of notes on paper, through one note, and other various locations but I wanted to provide one centralized spot that I could upload everything that I've learned. That is where this project came to fruition. I built this webpage to store all of my notes from what I have learned in my coding bootcamp journey. So far, I've learned the basic steps of how to build a webpage through HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git and then store that information in a repository through GitHub. I'm excited to learn and contribute even more dynamic content to this webpage as I move through the course.

## Usage

The webpage contains notes on what I've learned in HTMl, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. If you open the DevTools console on Chrome by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows), you can see the JavaScript running in the background. It will list all the topics that I've learned and choose one topic for you to study first.
